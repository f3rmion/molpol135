# Benchmark set for static molecular polarizabilities
The data of this repository has been extracted from the supporting information of Ref. [(Thakkar, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4932594).
All structures have been optimized using density functional theory at the CAM-B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP level of theory.

# Reference values
All experimental reference values are given in Bohr<sup>3</sup> the file ``references.data``. The first letter in parentheses denotes the type of experiment:
 - O : dipole oscillator
 - R : refractive index
 - D : dielectric permittivity
 - A : combined R and D data
 - E : electron-molecule scattering
 
An H after the comma denoted the high temperature experiment.
